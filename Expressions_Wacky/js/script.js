//Create a calculator using javascript and what was leaned.

//var a = prompt ("This input will do adding.\n Please enter a number")//input for first number to add
//var b = prompt ("This input will do adding.\n Please enter your second a number")//input for second number to add
//var totalAdding =  a + b;//adding two numbers together
//alert("This is the total of the two numbers you wanted added together. " + totalAdding);

//console.log(a + " adding");// first number for adding
//console.log(b + " adding");// second number for adding
//console.log(totalAdding + " adding");// first and second numbers for adding

//var c = prompt ("This input will multiply two numbers. \nPlease enter a number")
//var d = prompt ("This input will multiply two numbers. \nPlease enter second  number")
//var multiTotal = c * d;
//alert("This is the total of the two numbers you wanted multiplied. " + multiTotal );

//console.log(c + " multiply");// first number for multiplying
//console.log(d + " multiply");// second number for multiplying
//console.log(multiTotal +" multiply");//total of multiplied numbers

var e = prompt ("This input will do division.\n Please enter a number")//input for first number to divided by
var d = prompt("This input will division.\nPlease enter your second number.")//input for second number to be divided by
var dividTotal = e / d;// total of division

alert("This is the total of the two numbers you wanted divided. " + dividTotal );

console.log(e + " division");// first number for divided by
console.log(d + " division");// second number for divided by
console.log(dividTotal +" division");//total of divided numbers
