//Create a calculator using javascript and what was leaned.

var a = prompt ("This input will do adding.\n Please enter a number")//input for first number to add
var b = prompt ("This input will do adding.\n Please enter your second a number")//input for second number to add
var totalAdding =  a + + b;//adding two numbers together
alert("This is the total of the two numbers you wanted added together." + totalAdding);


console.log(a + " adding");// first number for adding
console.log(b + " adding");// first number for adding
console.log(totalAdding + " adding");// first and second numbers for adding
